films with title like ace - 15 selects and 15 total (no offset, no limit, no joins) !correct
films with title like ace - 15 selects but total count is 74 ((( (no offset, no limit, joins without require)

films with title like ace - 15 and total count is 15 ((( (no offset, no limit, joins with only language, no require)

films with title like ace - 15 selects but total count is 74 ((( (no offset, no limit, joins with require)

film relation is wrong((( does not matter if with require

// recheck: !!!!
  foreignKey: 'film_id',
  otherKey: 'actor_id'

// almost works, jiust need to recheck title(ac) and category(child)
